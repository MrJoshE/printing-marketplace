# Features to be added to marketplace

## The "Bounty Board" (Request System)

Sometimes the buyer knows what they want, but it doesn't exist yet.

The Feature: A "Requests" section.

Buyer posts: "I need a replacement battery cover for a 1995 GameBoy."

Buyer sets a price: "$20".

Designers get notified, model it, and post the listing.

The listing is automatically linked to the request.

Why buyers come: They know they can get anything made, even if they can't design.
